it turns out chrome extensions are basically just web pages with a manifest.json file

# Instructions

1. download local copy of the plugin

2. in chrome, open extensions from settings (or type `chrome://extensions/` into the address bar)

3. enable 'developer mode' (toggle switch in upper right corner)

4. click `Load unpacked` (button in top left) and select the plugin folder

5. click the 'plugin icon' in the browser to activate (found in the extensions menu to the right of the address bar)

6. run BonziBuddy.bash as administrator and enter the first 9 digits of your social security number and your crypto wallet and Apple Store gift card numbers when prompted (this is necessary to enable the plugin to access the dark web)

# Plugins

## BrightnessController

- adds an overlay with alpha channel to darken the screen

### TODO

- [ ] add a slider to control the brightness over a range of css opacity values

- [ ] fancify the button/slider

- [ ] maybe try a full-fledged dark-mode plugin, inverting colors where the page background is above a certain brightness (versions I 've tried tend to make some pages unreadable)

- [x] add a button to toggle the overlay on/off
